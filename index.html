      Come on, let's be influenced. <br>
      As a human behavioural tendency, we tend to follow influencers that everyone else follows. We always learn and get
      inspiration from influential people in the society. Sometimes there comes a time when we start imbibing the bad
      things also, they suggest. We always focus on things that provide immediate solutions without worrying about the
      consequences. Sometimes this effect can be negative. Sometimes we learn new things with factual-information like
      social problems, poverty, recession, finance, political situation in the country, current issues, technology,
      space science.
      Most of our time we spend on unnecessary things from which there is no ability to learn, which only gives
      temporary satisfaction. I am not saying that everything other than academic concepts are completely useless, they
      are equally important to refresh your mind but sometimes overuse can have a bad effect.
      Normally, we don't believe when a common man advises us about something harmful, but we always follow the advice
      of someone who has good influence in the society and has the ability to convey a good message. So, here are some
      of the best Indian YouTubers who give strong and effective messages to the society. Basically, the videos are
      based on current issues, trending topics, facts, political matters, corruption, terrorism, international and
      domestic conflicts between countries, violence, bad policies and politics, finance, superstations, religious
      scriptures, surrogating advertisements, and space science. Most of the videos have the same concept but each has a
      different way of presenting the topic. YouTubers of Indian origin are masterfully doing the work that should be
      done by the media in the country.
      If you are curious to know the unknown facts and concepts of the world then you can watch their videos. Even if
      you don't have basic knowledge of a particular concept, they try their best to explain it in simple terms that you
      can understand. There are many things we can learn from them like creating high quality content, presentation,
      deep study of topic, audience friendly video editing and fearlessness. I have written some thoughts about some of
      them below. It is not possible to include all of them here, so I have mentioned only top 5 of them.
      <br>

    <h2>Nitish Rajput</h2>
    <img src="Nitish Rajput 2.png" alt="" class="art-img-person">
    The face of "speaking fearlessly and impartially". One of favourite youtuber. How many of you speak candidly about
    politicians, corruption, election scams, social issues, film industry, and social customs? As far as I know, no one.
    The focus of the content is to reach out and make people aware of issues that the media does not cover. Nitish
    Rajput boldly presenting every topic in the country, watch his videos. He and his team are unsurpassed in organized
    thinking, conceptually precise and in-depth study.
    Who will openly criticize actors, politicians, and media in country? While everyone is cursing Indian media only one
    man has the guts to present the facts, hats off to you it is very sad that Indian media is in this poor state.
    <br>

    Some qualities of his videos: <br>
    Focuses on minute details.<br>
    Raising issues without fear of controversy and political influence. Great job with screenshots of statistics and
    facts about the concept.<br>
    A point-to-point discussion on the topic without any other nonsense.<br>
    Full use of democracy and freedom of expression.<br>
    Criticise openly. This person’s-controlled speaking speed and background music of the video will never let you skip
    the video.
    <br>


    <h2>Dhruv Rathee</h2>
    <img src="Dhruv Rathee 2.png" alt="" class="art-img-person">
    If "controversy" has a face. He came into limelight for his video "Reality of Kerala Story", for which he received
    death threats. Many of the videos are based on religion and controversy, so they can attract more viewers.
    After commenting on certain communities, some started calling him anti-Hindu and anti-nationalist and even also
    German Shepard. No matter how much and what people says, he is presenting the concept way better than any expert and
    we cannot deny the fact that he does not speak his mind, he presents concepts based on facts. There is no need to be
    offended if he speaks impartially with reference to facts. The focus is on historical mysteries, mythology, tragic
    reality, technology.
    People say that many videos of Dhruv Rathi are against Hindu culture and India but there are other videos from which
    we can learn new things. Yes, I too don't agree with some of his views, but it helps me understand the other side of
    the concept.
    The research and presentation of the concept is of high quality. I think everyone should watch this person's videos
    whether they are anti-communal or anti-national they help to know the exact and true essence of the concept. <br>
    Some good and strange qualities: <br>
    Informative, Controversial & personal point of view. <br>
    Excellent Video editing, Fearlessly raises issues. <br>
    Sad realities in societies. <br>


    <h2>Mohak Mangal</h2>
    <img src="Mohak Mangal 2.png" alt="" class="art-img-person">
    He has commented on unemployment, education system, poverty, Bollywood, sports, economic development, political
    problems, crises in the country, Indian Media, Historical Moments in India. A detailed study of education system and
    related subjects in India. Presentation of problems exacerbated by political interference and social conditions.
    Instant reaction to topics that are prevalent in society. Fearless presentation of issues in terms of facts. <br>
    Informative and detailed. <br>
    Ability to raise issues. <br>


    <h2>Priya Jain</h2>
    <img src="Priya Jain 2.png" alt="" class="art-img-person">
    Most of the videos are on Indian Judiciary and Laws. Untouchability, Law and Indian Judiciary, Violence, Terrorism,
    Subjects related to the Constitution, Current affairs, Case studies about big MNC’s, Sports, Technology has been
    given maximum emphasis. An accurate and comprehensive presentation of laws related to the Indian Constitution and
    detailed information on procedures in the Judiciary. Explanation of national and international issues in easy
    language. Excellent quality of content but no consistent user reach. <br>
    Qualities and Features of content:<br>
    Informative and detail oriented.<br>
    Contributions from various presenters.<br>
    A detailed explanation of the concept.<br>

    <h2>Abhi and Niyu</h2>
    <img src="Abhi and Niyu 2.png" alt="" class="art-img-person">
    A couple commenting on areas like criticism, Indian industrial sector, science and technology, pollution, finance,
    economy, social issues, politics, sports, film industry, terrorism, healthcare, mythology, and mystery.
    Both Abhi and Niyu faced body-shaming criticism for their outspoken comments on the subject.
    <br>
    Qualities and Features of content:<br>
    Informative and detail oriented.<br>
    Contributions from various presenters.<br>
    A detailed explanation of the concept.<br>
